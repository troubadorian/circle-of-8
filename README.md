Circle-of-8 : A Non-profit project

Mission: Saving lives during emergencies. Immediate blood donation

Idea proposed by: Biswajit Nayak [fb.com/mitubiswa](http://fb.com/mitubiswa)

Description
===========

"Circle of 8" is the circle of 8 people where your circle consists of 7 of your closest people, including your family members who you'll reach out to incase you need blood urgently.

If everyone of us forms such circles of 8 people, we'll make a network of blood donors. In case your circle doesn't contain any donors with a particular blood group type, you can reach out to anyone close to you for it.

Generally, at emergencies, we reach out to our relatives, or friends nearby, who we know well, for blood donation. In such circumstances, this can save lives.

Why 8?
======
8 was simply a number, initially proposed by Biswajit. To me, 8 represents 
* Two drops of blood, one inverted above another, indicating transfusion
* A rotated Infinity symbol
* An Hour Glass, representing hours of need
* Twice the size of a nuclear family

This number is perfect. It is small, therefore, one can remember the 8 people in the circle.

Expecting inputs from the community.
